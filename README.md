# The Linux Quiz

This is a website that @12ian3 and @chand1012 are developing to give Linux noobs and pros alike an easy online quiz to find their perfect distro! Currently the website is incomplete and doesn't work yet, but hopefully in the coming weeks we will have our first beta release!

If you want to contribute to the project, fork us and submit a PR!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development

For local development you need Yarn and Node. This website uses React.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chand1012/thelinuxquiz.git
cd thelinuxquiz
yarn
# to start the development server
yarn start
```

## Frameworks

This project is using the [Geist UI Framework](https://react.geist-ui.dev/en-us) to aid in development. This is a UI framework that takes most of the work out of CSS and allows us to write the app without having to style much ~~if anything at all~~.
